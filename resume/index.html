		<h2>What about me?</h2>
		<p>I'm a front end developer with a passion for responsive web design and the user experience. I enjoy a challenge and that's why I am constantly learning and honing my skils. My strength lies in coding, but I am developing my design skill as well. All skill sets are not created equal which is why I prefer to be part of a team that collaborates and learns from each other. I believe that a collaborative culture inspires creativty. </p>
		<p>On a more personal note, I watch a lot of movies and videos. Some of what I watch is informative, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm easily entertained and get sucked into watching just about anything. And then there's music &#8212; I have to have something playing in the background almost all of the time. I like to think of it as the soundtrack of my life &#8212; except I'm not that deep. Last, but not least, my lovely wife and I have been married 10 years, and have no kids, but have spent our extra time traveling to some really beautiful places.</p>
		<p>My other passions include border collies, goats, and garlic...in that order. </p>
